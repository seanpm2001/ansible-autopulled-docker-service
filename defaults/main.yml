# Definition of containers.
#xsf_autopulled_docker_service_containers:
#- name: <string>
#  image: <string>
#  portmap:
#  [ - host: <portnumber>
#      guest: <portnumber>
#      bind: <ip> ]
#  check_on: <string>
#
# The `name` must be a valid file name. It must not contain slashes, and
# whitespace will yield pain, too. Stick to ASCII if possible.
#
# The `image` must be a valid docker image ref to be pulled. Periodically,
# a check will run which checks for a newer version under the same tag. If a
# new version is found, the container is stopped and replaced.
#
# The `portmap` must be a (possibly empty) array of port map entries. The
# `host` of each entry is the port number on the host side of the port
# exposure. `guest` is the port number inside the container. `bind` is
# optional (defaulting to 127.0.0.1) and defines the IP address on the host
# side to which the port will bind.
#
# `check_on` must be a valid value for a systemd timer `OnCalendar` property.
# This defines the rhythm in which a check for updates is run.
#
# Example:
#
#xsf_autopulled_docker_service_containers:
#- name: xmpp.org_extensions
#  image: xmppxsf/xeps:latest
#  portmap:
#  - host: 7002
#    guest: 80
#    bind: '127.0.0.1'
#  check_on: '*-*-* *:0/5:00'
#
# This runs the xmppxsf/xeps:latest in a container called xmpp.org_extensions
# and exposes port 80 of the container on 127.0.0.1:7002. The image is updated
# every five minutes.
